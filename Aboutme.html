												<h3>Qualifications</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I am registered with the Australian Counselling Association (ACA) and on the Australian Register of Counsellors & Psychotherapists (ARCAP).
												I follow the ACA's guide of ethical practice to provide a quality and safe service.</p>
											<p>Experience is the most valuable teacher. However, I wanted as much peace of mind for my clients as myself; after my undergraduate degree I 
												completed two subsequent post graduate qualifications, with the latter being a Master of Counselling.</p>

												<h3>My values</h3>
											</header>
											<p>When I assess my values, I realise how they have transformed through life. 
												I once would consider the likes of Achievement, Success and Status important to me.</p>
												<p>My core values lie in Authenticity, Compassion and Curiosity... and finish with Balance, Love and Peace.
												I am a forever learner, so I hope to add Spirituality to my list soon.</p>

										<h2>Who is Christopher and what's he about?</h2>
										<p>I try not to take myself too seriously,
											but the passion I put into my work and relationships I take very, very seriously. 
										</p>
									</header>
									<a href="#" onclick="return false;" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="Christopher Malone sitting in front of artwork" /></a>
									<p>Peers in my field have described me as 'a balance of masculine 
										and feminine energy'; this I use to assist in connecting you with your true self with clarity and purpose 
										in life.
										My path to becoming a counsellor wasn't traditional. I spent two decades navigating the corporate world, 
										analysing data and leading teams of people. This experience honed my analytical skills, igniting a passion 
										for understanding the human side of things once becoming a people leader â€“ the emotions, experiences, and 
										relationships that make us who we are. My additional background working in Correctional Services highlighted 
										the complex challenges individuals face. I can help you identify your patterns and thought processes while 
										creating a space for understanding and compassion.</p>
									<p>Lived experiences as a husband, father, and someone who has exposure to relationship challenges, complex family 
										dynamics, addiction and neurodiversity inform my approach. I understand these struggles firsthand, walking 
										alongside you with empathy and understanding. </p>
									<p>My journey has enabled me to realised challenges we face each day can be overwhelming, and navigating them alone can seem impossible.
										My passion lies in guiding others in a no pressure environment towards a clear understanding of their struggles. 
										Unearthing the root of these challenges is incredibly freeing, paving the way for a more empowered and joyful life.
										I live by the mantra that authenticity is the key. For this to be true there is no judgment here, and no topic is taboo. 
										I believe true healing comes from a place of complete openness and honesty. 
										Society can make us feel as though we we have to wear a mask and not be true to who we are.
										Together, we can create a safe environment where you feel empowered to be authentic, your true sense of self.</p>
