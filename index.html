              <p> There's no judgment here, and no topic is taboo. I believe true healing comes from a place of complete openness and honesty. Society can make us feel as though we we have to wear a mask and not be true to who we are. I'm a guest in your world, and I endeavour to respectfully and deeply understand it. Together, we can create a safe environment where you feel empowered to be authentic, your true sense of self. </p>

            <h3>A Word From Christopher</h3>
            <p>
              <span class="image right">
                <img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Chris Malone" />
              </span>My path to becoming a mental health professional wasn't traditional. Before becoming a counsellor, I spent two decades navigating the corporate world, analysing data and leading teams of people. This experience honed my analytical skills, igniting a passion for understanding the human side of things once becoming a people leader â€“ the emotions, experiences, and relationships that make us who we are.
            </p>
            <p> My additional background working in Correctional Services highlighted the complex challenges individuals face. That's why I bridge the gap between analysis and empathy. I can help you identify your patterns and thought processes while creating a space for understanding and compassion. </p>
            <p> Lived experiences as a husband, father, and someone who has exposure to relationship challenges, complex family dynamics, addiction and neurodiversity inform my approach. I understand these struggles firsthand, walking alongside you with empathy and understanding. Peers in my field have described me as 'a balance of masculine and feminine energy'; this I use to assist in gaining clarity and purpose in life for those who seek it. </p>
            <p>- Chris</p>

                <h3 class="major">Accessibility</h3>
                <p> Sometimes just getting through the day can feel overwhelming, and scheduling an appointment might seem like another hurdle. That's why I offer flexible counselling options to make getting the support you need easier. Whether you prefer in-person sessions, secure online telehealth, or text-based support, I'm here for you. Distance shouldn't be a barrier to receiving help, especially for those living in rural areas. </p>

                <h3 class="major">Therapeutic approach</h3>
                <p> My counselling style is rooted in humanism, prioritising a person-centered approach that empowers you to explore your experiences and find your own solutions. I integrate other modalities, such as attachment theory or behavioural interventions, to best suit your unique needs. There are no gimmicks, hidden agendas or lectures here - the science behind human psychology is used to provide complete autonomy of your circumstances. </p>
